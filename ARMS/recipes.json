Once your glaze has thickened, turn off the heat and set aside until the \u2018meat\u2019 loaf is cooked.",

        "Lift off the loaf tin and peel off any greaseproof paper that has stuck. Pour lashings of the BBQ glaze over the \u2018meat\u2019 loaf, then place the tray back into the oven for a further 10 minutes so that the glaze caramelizes over the loaf. Serve immediately, topped with cherry tomatoes and saut\u00e9ed sage leaves."
