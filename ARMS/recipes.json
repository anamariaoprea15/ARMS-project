        "Peel pumpkin and beetroot and cut into rough chunks, approx. 3 cm square.\u00a0Roast in the oven at 180C\u00a0on separate baking trays, until tender and can be mashed.\u00a0Use them to add to the mix at step 8.",
        "Measure out your lentils, place them in a colander and rinse under cold water for a couple of minutes, until the water runs clear - this is to remove some of the starch from the lentils, which can make them a bit mushy when cooked.",
        "In a medium-sized saucepan, put the washed lentils and enough water to cover them by at least 2 - 2.5 cm. You are going to cook them, but not all the way through, as we need them to be still slightly firm to start.",
        "Bring the lentils to the boil over a high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer (without a lid), for about 4-5 minutes. The lentils should be slightly undercooked,\u00a0not soft and mushy. (Whilst you are waiting for the lentils to cook, you can start peeling and chopping the vegetables \u2013 see step 4). Drain and rinse the lentils under cold water in a colander, and set aside to cool.",

        "Pick the fresh herb leaves off their stems, and measure out \u00bd cup of leaves.\u00a0 Really pack the leaves into the \u00bd cup (a mug is fine if you don\u2019t have a measuring cup).",
        "Add the lentils, garlic, onion, fresh herbs, flaxseed, ras el hanout, paprika and salt and pepper to a food processor or blender. Pulse, using on/off pulses, until finely chopped, but not a paste.\u00a0 You may need to carefully scrape the sides and bottom of the food processor/blender bowl a few times in between pulses, so that the mixture is evenly chopped.",
        "Scrape the mixture into 2 separate mixing bowls.\u00a0Add mashed pumpkin to one bowl, and mashed beetroot to the other, so that you have one bowl of orange mixture and one of purple mixture.",
        "Stir in 1.5 tbsps of plain flour into each bowl, until it is all blended. Taste the mixture and add more salt and pepper, ras el hanout\u00a0or paprika depending on your taste.",
        "Preheat your oven to 190 C.",
        "Shaping the falafel balls: get your baking tray ready, by lining it with baking paper, and brushing the paper lightly with some vegetable oil.\u00a0Make small falafel balls of approx. ping pong ball size in each colour \u2013 orange and purple.\u00a0Place each finished ball on the baking sheet on your baking tray, leaving at least 1.5cm gap between them.",
        "Once all the balls are shaped and on the baking tray, place the tray in the preheated oven and bake for 12 -14 minutes\u00a0or until they start to become golden and crisp on the outside.\u00a0If they are still slightly moist, put them back in the oven again for another 2-4 minutes.\u00a0 Once the balls are golden brown and the surface appears dry, you can remove the tray from the oven.",
        "Serving options are endless -\u00a0the falafels taste great with\u00a0a piece of pita bread or in a salad!"

      "title": "BBQ 'Meat' Loaf",
      "ingredients": [
        "150g (1\u00bd cups) sweet potato, cubed",
        "250g (9oz) portobello mushrooms",
        "2 tbsp olive oil",
        "1 onion, finely chopped",
        "3 garlic cloves, minced",
        "1 red (bell) pepper, diced",

        "2 tsp dried thyme",
        "1 tsp cayenne pepper",
        "125g (1 cup) walnuts, finely chopped",
        "50g (1 cup) panko breadcrumbs",
        "1 x 400-g (14-oz) can chickpeas (garbanzos), drained",
        "Zest of 1 lemon",
        "Sea salt and black pepper"
      ],
      "method": [
        "Preheat your oven to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F). Line a medium-sized loaf tin with greaseproof paper. Steam the sweet potato until the flesh is soft. Add the mushrooms to a blender and blitz until they are finely chopped.",
        "Place a large non-stick saucepan over a medium heat. Add the oil and, when hot, add the mushrooms. Saut\u00e9 them for around 5 minutes so that you get rid of some of the water inside them and get them nicely golden.",
        "Next add the onion, garlic and red (bell) pepper to the pan, plus the herbs, spices and a pinch each of sea salt and black pepper. Saut\u00e9 the mixture for a further 5 minutes, stirring often.",
        "When you\u2019ve got a nice colour on everything, add the sweet potato. Saut\u00e9 the mix for a few more minutes before adding the breadcrumbs, chopped walnuts, chickpeas (garbanzos) and lemon zest. Stir until all the ingredients are well combined. Turn the heat off, then use a potato masher to lightly mash the mix, breaking down any large chunks of sweet potato and the chickpeas. Spoon the mixture into your lined loaf tin, compacting it in as much as you can. Place the \u2018meat\u2019 loaf on the bottom shelf of your oven and let it roast for 40 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, make that lovely BBQ glaze. Add all the ingredients to a small saucepan with a pinch each of salt and pepper and mix well. Place over a low heat and allow it to bubble away for around 10 minutes. Stir every now and then. Once your glaze has thickened, turn off the heat and set aside until the \u2018meat\u2019 loaf is cooked.",
        "Once your \u2018meat\u2019 loaf has been in the oven for 40 minutes, take that baby out. Let it stand for around 10 minutes before placing a flat baking sheet on top. Carefully, while holding the tray in place with one hand and the loaf tin with the other, turn the tray upside down so that the \u2018meat\u2019 loaf comes out.",
        "Lift off the loaf tin and peel off any greaseproof paper that has stuck. Pour lashings of the BBQ glaze over the \u2018meat\u2019 loaf, then place the tray back into the oven for a further 10 minutes so that the glaze caramelizes over the loaf. Serve immediately, topped with cherry tomatoes and saut\u00e9ed sage leaves."
